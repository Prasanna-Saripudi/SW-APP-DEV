        <dt>What is Coronavirus?</dt>
        <dd>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans,
            several
            coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe
            diseases
            such as
            Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).</dd>

        <dt>What is COVID-19?</dt>
        <dd>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered
            coronavirus.
            This new virus and disease were
            unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.</dd>

        <dt>How it spreads?</dt>
        <dd>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus in ways below:
            <li>The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are
                spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around
                the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their
                eyes, nose or mouth.</li>
            <li>People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with
                COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.</li> This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter
            (3 feet) away from a
            person who is sick.
