            <dt>What is Coronavirus?</dt>
            <dd>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans,
                several
                coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe
                diseases
                such as
                Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).</dd>

            <dt>What is COVID-19?</dt>
            <dd>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered
                coronavirus.
                This new virus and disease were
                unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.</dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
            <dt>How it spreads?</dt>
            <dd>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus in ways below:
                <li>The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which
                    are
                    spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and
                    surfaces
                    around
                    the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then
                    touching
                    their
                    eyes, nose or mouth.</li>
                <li>People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with
                    COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.</li> This is why it is important to stay more than
                1
                meter
                (3 feet) away from a
                person who is sick.
